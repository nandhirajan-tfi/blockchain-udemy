What is Ethereum
- Transfer of money through network and store data
- Different Ethereum Networks
  - TestNet -> For Testing
  - Can create our own Ethereum Network
- Network are formed by one or more nodes. Each node is a machine running Ethereum Client
- Each node has full copy of a Blockchain
- Blockchain is a database that stores a record of every transaction

Interfacing with Ethereum Networks
- Developers use web3.js
- Consumers use Metamask

Metamask
- Account Address
- Public Key
- Private Key

Account Address -> Common across all networks
Public Key + Private Key -> Combines together to form the password. Used to authorize funds sending from the account to other account

Receiving Ethereum?
Project URL - https://rinkeby-faucet.com/
Steps:
 - Get the wallet address from client
 - Send the address to backend server
 - Server use web3 library to create a transaction
 - Server send the transaction object to Rinkeby test network
 - Server wait for the transaction to be confirmed
 - Send success message to client
 
 What is Transaction?
 - Transaction will not communicate with entire network. It will always go to one node. That node will communicate with other nodes in network
 - Node has the blockchains internally
 - Will accept multiple transactions at same time. Combining all these transactions are block
 - Node will validate the block. This process is called mining
 
 Gas Free - Amount of Ether paid for processing the transaction
 Start Gas / Gas Limit - Uni of Gas this transaction can consume
 v,r,s 
  - Generated from Sender's private key to get Sender's account address
  - With private key, we can generate v,r,s. Other way is not possible
